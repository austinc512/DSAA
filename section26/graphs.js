/*
A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices 
or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an 
undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph.

wow, big words!

So basically we have a bunch of nodes, and connections between those nodes.

In a singly linked list, we had nodes that connected to each other in a singular direction.
In a binary search tree, we had a root node with up to 2 children, and all subsequent children 
could have up to 2 children of their own. 

Think of a social media platform like facebook. Individuals will be nodes, and friends will have 
a line between them. You can start to see clusters of related people that are all connected to 
each other. Maybe they went to college together, or maybe they work at the same business. 

“Frequently bought with” on amazon.

A user’s shopping cart might contain data about what products are normally bought with each other. 
These products can be nodes, and the frequency of these products being bought together might 
create some score that associates item A with item B. This information can be stored in a graph, 
and be used to suggest products that you might want to purchase together.
